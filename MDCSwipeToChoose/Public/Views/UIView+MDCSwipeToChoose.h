 * The `UIView (MDCSwipeToChoose)` category adds a pan gesture recognizer
 * to any view, via the `mdc_swipeToChooseSetup:` method. By specifying
 * blocks to be executed when the view is panned via an instance of
 * `MDCSwipeOptions`, you may add custom behavior based on the panning motion.
 *
 * This is a more generic version of the `MDCSwipeToChooseView` class.

/*!
 * Adds swipe-to-choose functionality to an instance of `UIView`.
 * You may customize the selection threshold and other parameters by
 * setting the corresponding settings on the `options` argument.
 * Passing `nil` for the `options` parameter configures the view with
 * the default set of options.

 * Programmatically swipes the view in the direction specified.
 *
 * Specifying a direction of MDCSwipeDirectionNone swipes the view
 * if the swipe threshold is currently exceeded, and returns it to
 * its original position otherwise.
 *
 * If you haven't called `mdc_swipeToChooseSetup:` already, this will call
 * that method and perform setup using the default set of options.
